While initial ideas like \"Good morning all\" are serviceable, they are time-dependent, and therefore not ideal. I'm leaning toward a more flexible option; the possibilities are getting fewer.\n\n\n**Selecting a Final Greeting**\n\nI'm now comparing candidates. \"Well hello there\" and \"Hello to you\" are strong possibilities. My decision now hinges on the tone of each phrase. I'll test them in context next.\n\n\n**Revisiting Greeting Options**\n\nI'm now back to the drawing board. I'm considering various options, now including \"How are you?\". My focus is to select the most straightforward and adaptable three-word greeting. I'm still trying to find the best option.\n\n\n**Analyzing Greeting Choices**\n\nI am now comparing \"Well hello there\" and \"Good morning all.\" I am still working to comply with the three-word constraint.
